The Instagram Profile Finder transforms basic contact information (name, location, email) into comprehensive Instagram profile data with AI-verified accuracy. The system processes hundreds of profiles automatically, delivering detailed social media intelligence directly to your Google Sheets.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Intelligent Search**: Uses enterprise SERP proxies to find Instagram profiles across Google search results
- **AI Matching**: Gemini AI evaluates and ranks potential matches with confidence scores
- **Real-time Processing**: Live updates to Google Sheets with processing status and results
- **Comprehensive Data**: Extracts 20+ profile attributes including followers, verification status, and bio analysis

## Why It's Valuable

**For Marketing Teams**: Build targeted influencer lists with follower counts and engagement data
**For Sales Teams**: Discover prospect social presence and engagement levels  
**For Recruitment**: Verify candidate profiles and assess their online presence
**For Research**: Analyze social media patterns across demographic groups

## System Architecture

The system operates through three intelligent layers:

### 1. Search Discovery Layer
```python
# Executes optimized Google searches via BrightData SERP proxy
usernames, metadata, query_results = extractor.batch_search_instagram_profiles(
    name="John Smith", 
    location="New York", 
    email="john@company.com"
)
```

**What happens**: Constructs smart search queries like `site:instagram.com John Smith New York instagram` and processes up to 20 search results to identify potential Instagram profiles.

### 2. AI Evaluation Layer
```python
# Gemini AI analyzes all found profiles and selects the best match
gemini_result = matcher.evaluate_profiles_with_gemini(
    name="John Smith",
    location="New York", 
    metadata_dict=found_profiles
)
# Returns: {"best_match": "johnsmith_ny", "confidence_score": 85, "reasoning": "..."}
```

**What happens**: AI considers name similarity, location references in bio, follower patterns, and account authenticity to rank matches from 0-100 confidence.

### 3. Data Extraction Layer
```python
# Retrieves comprehensive profile data for verified matches
profile_data = extractor.get_instagram_data("johnsmith_ny", confidence_score=85, "John Smith")
```

**What happens**: Fetches detailed Instagram data including follower counts, bio analysis, verification status, and engagement metrics.
