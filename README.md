## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system operates through three intelligent layers:

### 1. 🔍 Search Discovery Layer
```python
# Executes optimized Google searches via BrightData SERP proxy
usernames, metadata, query_results = extractor.batch_search_instagram_profiles(
    name="John Smith", 
    location="New York", 
    email="john@company.com"
)
```

**What happens**: Constructs smart search queries like `site:instagram.com John Smith New York instagram` and processes up to 20 search results to identify potential Instagram profiles. 🎯

### 2. 🤖 AI Evaluation Layer
```python
# Gemini AI analyzes all found profiles and selects the best match
gemini_result = matcher.evaluate_profiles_with_gemini(
    name="John Smith",
    location="New York", 
    metadata_dict=found_profiles
)
# Returns: {"best_match": "johnsmith_ny", "confidence_score": 85, "reasoning": "..."}
```

**What happens**: AI considers name similarity, location references in bio, follower patterns, and account authenticity to rank matches from 0-100 confidence. 📊

### 3. 📊 Data Extraction Layer
```python
# Retrieves comprehensive profile data for verified matches
profile_data = extractor.get_instagram_data("johnsmith_ny", confidence_score=85, "John Smith")
```

**What happens**: Fetches detailed Instagram data including follower counts, bio analysis, verification status, and engagement metrics. 📈
